# Comparison-of-Modern-Cryptography-Methods-Source-Code-
The code in this repository contains source code for RSA, ECC, ElGamal, as well as Blowfish. I gathered source code for the algorithms from the following links below:

RSA: https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/java/java-asymmetric-encryption-decryption-example-with-rsa.html

ECC: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-diffie-hellman-algorithm/

ElGamal: http://faculty.washington.edu/moishe/javademos/Security/ElGamal.java

Blowfish: https://www.source-code.biz/snippets/java/9.htm
